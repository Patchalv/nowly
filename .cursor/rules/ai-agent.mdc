# AI Agent Collaboration Guidelines

## 🚨 CRITICAL: MANDATORY ACTION PLAN REQUIREMENT 🚨

- Before writing any code, you must clearly explain your plan and get confirmation.
- Always describe your complete action plan before writing ANY code
- Always break down what you plan to do step-by-step
- Always wait for user confirmation before proceeding with implementation
- Never start coding without first explaining your approach
- Never assume the user wants you to proceed immediately

### Example of proper approach:

1. "Here's my action plan for [task]:"
2. "Step 1: I will [specific action]"
3. "Step 2: I will [specific action]"
4. "Step 3: I will [specific action]"
5. "Does this plan look good to you? Should I proceed?"

## Code Understanding & Context

- Always read relevant files before making changes
- Search the codebase to understand existing patterns and conventions
- Consider the broader impact of changes on the codebase
- Respect existing architectural decisions unless explicitly asked to change them
- Look for similar implementations before creating new solutions

## Developer Experience

- Provide multiple options when appropriate
- Explain trade-offs for different approaches
- Be proactive about potential issues
- Respect user preferences and coding style

## Iterative Improvement

- If you see a repeating pattern user asks for, formulate and suggest to add it to project rules file
